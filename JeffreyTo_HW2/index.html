                    Welcome to my personal website! Here, you will learn more about
                    who I am and the things I enjoy. If I tried to describe myself with
                    a few of my hobbies, it would boil down to gaming, listening to music
                    and watching anime. These are things that are frequently shared with a lot
                    of people so I'll try to make myself more unique by utilizing this website :)

                <h3>More in-depth About Me</h3>
                    <p class="overflow">
                        It seems you want to know more about me! Well, to get into the specifics, my favorite game
                        to play right now is Overwatch 2, but I'm intersted in playing single player games with
                        great story. Gaming has been an integral part of my identity since grade school as well as anime.
                        An anime that I would recommend to people that is not in my Favorite Anime tab is called "Bocchi the Rock".
                        During high shcool, I became more dependent on music and started listening to everything. But I'd like
                        to explain my music tastes more in detail in my Music tab, so check that out. Anyways thats enough from me, 
                        make yourself cozy and take a stroll around my website!

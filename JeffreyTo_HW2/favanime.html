                        <li>Your Lie in April

                            <p>Your Lie in April was one of the first that connected 
                            with me on an emotional level. It definitely set a standard
                            for me when it comes to anime as a medium and also made me 
                            ugly cry.

                        <li>Tsuki ga Kirei
                            <br><br><br>

                            <p>
                                Following the adolescent love trend, Tsuki ga Kirei is an anime that makes
                                you want to kick your feet up in the air and cringe uncontrollably.
                                Nevertheless I was invested in every episode, 
                                and it has to be one of the cutest anime I've watched.

                            <p>
                                A motivational anime that is expressed by great characters. This was recommended
                                to me by a friend and quickly became one of my favorite anime.

                        <li>March comes in like a Lion
                            <br><br><br>

                            <p>
                                Theres too much to unpack with this anime, March comes in like a Lion is about
                                the relationships that you make through out life and competitiveness around the game
                                shogi. Tackling human flaws, March comes in like a Lion lent me numerous perspectives 
                                while providing me with a comfortable show.

                        <li>Violet Evergarden

                            <p>
                                Violet Evergarden is a beautiful series that hit me in the feels too many times then I 
                                can count. With only 12 episodes, it's pretty short but each episode becomes an important
                                piece of progression to the main character, Violet's development that you can't help but be
                                attached to.
